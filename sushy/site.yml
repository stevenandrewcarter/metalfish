# Install and configure the sushy emulator locally. The emulator will be listening on the OOB network only.
# The sushy emulator will be backed against a local libvirt instance.
# NB: We will assume everything will be executed against the root user on the host. Since these are lab environments it
# should not cause a problem in doing everything as root!
